# TextRank
My implementation of the TextRank algorithm

Instructions:
 
First argument: The location of the text file to run TextRank on
Example: if your file is located at "C:\Users\p\Desktop\text\text.txt" that would be the first argument
Second argument: Either "k" or "s" Where k represents getting the keywords part of TextRank and s represents the sentences part of TextRank
Example: k
Example: s

Third argument: The flag representing the type of data and information should be extracted

If the second argument is k then there are 2 flags:
flag of 0 prints all the keywords with their scores printed next to them
flag of 1 prints all the keywords without their scores printed next to them

If the second argument is s then there are 3 flags:
flag of 0 prints all the sentences with their scores printed next to them
flag of 1 prints all the sentences without their scores printed next to them
flag of 2 prints the top 100 words
